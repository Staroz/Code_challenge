# Code_challenge

Hi, I'm Marco Urquidi, in this oportunity I want to show you the process of my learned programation since I start this facinate world of Programation.

In this repository where you'll find some excersice of logical of programation, these are solving in Javascript and were solving of page such as:
  -  Codewars (https://www.codewars.com/users/Staroz/badges/large)
  -  HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com/marcourquidi17?hr_r=1)

Despite the fact that I practiced for a while, I'm back and ready to improve every day, so I'll be uploading new challenges every day, so feel free to leave me any comments.

All tasks have the description of challenge, the code with I resolved it and the date of resolution.
